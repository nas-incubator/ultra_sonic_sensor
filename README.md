Ultrasonic Sensor with Arduino
This project demonstrates how to interface an ultrasonic sensor with an Arduino board. The ultrasonic sensor is used to measure the distance between the sensor and an object. The trigger pin of the sensor is connected to pin 9, and the echo pin is connected to pin 10 of the Arduino.

*Components Required
  Arduino Board (e.g., Uno, Mega)
  Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
  Jumper Wires
  Breadboard (optional)
  USB Cable for Arduino

*How It Works
  Trigger Pin: The trigger pin sends out an ultrasonic pulse. This pulse travels through the air until it hits an object and reflects back to the sensor.
  Echo Pin: The echo pin receives the reflected pulse. The time taken for the pulse to travel to the object and back is measured.
  Distance Calculation: The distance is calculated using the time taken by the pulse and the speed of sound in the air.

  *Uploading the Code
  1. Connect your Arduino: Use the USB cable to connect your Arduino board to your computer.
  2. Select your board and port: In the Arduino IDE, go to Tools > Board and select your Arduino board. Then, go to Tools > Port and select the correct port for your Arduino.
  3. Upload the code: Click the upload button (right arrow) in the Arduino IDE to compile and upload the code to your Arduino board.
